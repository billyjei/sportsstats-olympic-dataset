This is a case study completed as part of the SQL for Data Science Capstone Project.

## About Sportstats

SportsStats is a sports analysis firm partnering with local news and elite personal trainers to provide “interesting” insights to help their partners.  Insights could be patterns/trends highlighting certain groups/events/countries, etc. for the purpose of developing a news story or discovering key health insights.

## Project Overview

The project aims to analyze the SportsStats dataset to extract meaningful insights that can benefit SportsStats' partners, including local news outlets and personal trainers. The audience interested in my findings includes trends in different countries and sports events insights from the data.
