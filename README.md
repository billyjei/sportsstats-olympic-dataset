## About Sportstats

SportsStats is a sports analysis firm partnering with local news and elite personal trainers to provide “interesting” insights to help their partners.  Insights could be patterns/trends highlighting certain groups/events/countries, etc. for the purpose of developing a news story or discovering key health insights.

## Project Overview

As a junior data analyst on Cyclistic's marketing analytics team, I have been tasked with conducting a comprehensive data analysis to provide insights and recommendations to the executives. This analysis involves exploring, processing, and analyzing relevant data to make data-driven decisions.
